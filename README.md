# Projectile-Tracking
This project learns how projectiles behave using some examples of different projectile trajectories. Finally the learned model can be used to track a new projectile through time, given the throwing velocity vector of the new projectile.

------------

The project requires requires:

- Python (>= 2.7)
- NumPy (>= 1.8.2)
- scikit-learn (>= 0.15.1)
- matplotlib (>= 1.3.1)
